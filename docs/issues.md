## List of known issues

# Title of the page:

* When browsing with navigation menu, the page title is increasingly adding "Add - " prefix, and title
won't change using twig "pageTitle" variable, it shows "Dashboard" or goes blank but with that prefix.

* A colon is displaying before Issue's reporter name, at the header of the view page. I am not able to locate
where it comes from.
